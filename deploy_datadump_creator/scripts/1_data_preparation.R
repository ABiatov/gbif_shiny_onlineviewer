# ----------------------------------
# The script takes a dataset with scientific names and conservation status info, 
# and returns two files: list of two with species lookup (matching) results, and 
# csv with names require manual editing.
# 
# Inputs:
# full spreadsheet with Latin names of taxa and data on their inclusion/status in
# various red lists ("checklist-protected-species-....csv").
# 
# Outputs:
# 1) matches.Rdata - list of two with the result of name matching.
#   [[1]] - "goodmatch" - Names whose matching is satisfactory - we will then look 
#   for occurrences for these names using taxon keys.
#   [[2]] - "badmatch" - Names whose matching is supposed to be wrong/unsatisfactory. 
#   We will then look for occurrences for these names using concatenated strings 
#   of possible verbatim scientific names.
# 2) "higherrank.csv" - csv file with Latin names that need to be completed by all
#   possible verbatim scientific names available in GBIF manually.

# for occurrences by taxon key efficiently. The only option left is to search by 
# the verbatinScientificName field (names, assigned by data authors). Since each 
# taxa can be represented in GBIF datasets with various verbatim (scientific) names, 
# we need to edit "higherrank.csv" manually, adding all possible spellings for each name.
# The results must be saved as "higherrank_nameVariants.csv".
# Do not remove/rename current "higherrank_nameVariants.csv", unless you prepared 
# the next version by yourself! It required a lot of manual work - be respectful.
